## 🌠 A Bit Beyond the Clouds

Outside the tech trenches, I’m an **astronomy enthusiast** and evangelist. When I’m not designing solutions, I’m often under the night sky — stargazing, mapping constellations, and contemplating the mysteries of our universe.

I bring the same curiosity and sense of scale to my work in technology — always exploring, always optimizing, always reaching for what’s next.
